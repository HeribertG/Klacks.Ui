## Security Best Practices for Contributors

- Never commit secrets or environment-specific configuration to the repository.
- Use Angular's built-in security features (e.g., Sanitize) when handling dynamic content.
- Ensure all dependencies are tracked via `package-lock.json`.
- Monitor Dependabot alerts for vulnerable npm packages.
